        I conducted research to gain a better understanding of potential
        frictions users face when shopping online. These are my goals:

        <p className='my-9'>
          From the home page, I am not sure where to go to look for product
          categories. It is hard to find the navigation menu. The text size is
          small and barely visible against the colored background.

              The shop layouts deviates from typical UI patterns we see on other
              e-commerce websites, where we see product cards displayed in
              uniform grid.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each product category page layouts are also inconsistent (see
              left).

              Overall, the lack of visual cues make the website clunky to
              navigate.

              We need to scroll down to see more product categories but the

            </p>
            <p className='mb-6'>
              The loading indicator is also tiny and is positioned on the very
              top right corner.

          I looked into the websites of Zaraâ€™s direct competitors, smaller-scale
          e-commerce shops, and well-established luxury brands to explore design
          choices and generate inspiration for my designs.

        <img src={`${zaraImg.compAnalysis}`} alt='Competitor analysis' />
        <p className='mt-8'>
          In summary, these websites use a diverse range of design choices
          (combining navigation features, accent colors, UI layouts, etc.) to
          highlight call-to-actions and guide users on completing their tasks.
          This provided me with an abundant design toolkit to work with later
          on.

          I interviewed 8 participants between the ages of 22 to 36, who
          frequently shop online, through video calls and in-person chats. I
          recruited my participants from my personal network and design
          communities.
