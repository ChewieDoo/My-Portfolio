# Launching david.decodes

My profile coded in React Framework with Tailwind CSS.

The code is destructured so that if any changes need to be made, I just need to edit the JS object that I have created inside `Context.jsx`. The React components uses the data context to then render specific parts of the webpage.

I try to keep the jsx components below 100 lines when possible and destructure as much as I can to make it easy to read and understand.

Tasks:

- COMPLETED Figure out responsive CSS (when in mobile or smaller display size, wrap the social icons around)
- COMPLETED Route up the links
- COMPLETED Organize code into React framework (data context, Tailwind components, etc.)
- Develop Zara page
- Develop Depop page
- Deploy website
